# What

This is a demo for using (adonis-bull)[https://github.com/Rocketseat/adonis-bull/tree/alpha] package

#### Install


```sh
yarn install
```

### To run

1. On terminal tab#left


```sh
yarn dev
```

This will run the server on an open port, it should be 3333 by default.


2. On terminal tab#right

This will create a bull processer 

```
node ace bull:listen -b -p 9999
```

3. Go to `http://0.0.0.0:3333/?helloTo=felix` in your browser or send a get via Postman etc.

Your portnumber might be different so you might want to fix that in the url.
